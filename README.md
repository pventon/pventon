- 👋 Hi, my name is Peter Venton; welcome to my GitHub account. I spent 35 years working in the Air Traffic Control IT industry in at least 15 different countries and specialise in Flight Data Processing (FDP). The last 12 years were spent in the Middle East; I'm currently residing in the USA taking a break from work. I have a company called Flight ATM Systems Ltd. (www.flightatm.com) that sells FDP related software products with very limited success, (its not exactly a phone App!). My company often received requests for ICAO message processing and an AFTN terminal application at basement bargain prices which was impossible to do given the quantity of sales made through the company. As a result of numerous enquiries for 'cheaper' FDP products I have decided to re-write some of (or maybe all time permitting) of the FDP software I have written to date in Python and started this GitHub account in order to make this an open source project.
- As of 22 November 2022 there are three repositories:
- - ICAO Field 15 Parser
- - ICAO ATS and OLDI Message Parser
- - AFTN Terminal Application
- The software is written in Python; I hope someone finds these implementations useful.
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering in general. I have a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics and almost completed an MBA in Technology Management (2.5 of 3 years completed). In my younger years I started off life as an electronics engineer; hence I have a very good understanding of both hardware and software.
- 🌱 This GitHub account has been created in order to provide hopefully useful knowledge about parsing ICAO messages; its my contribution to the sum knowledge of the Interwebs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects releated to FDP processing should anyone be mad enough to be working on this not so well understood topic.
- 📫 I can be contacted at peter.venton@flightatm.com
