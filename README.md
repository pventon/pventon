- 👋 Hi, my name is Peter Venton, I spent 35 years working in the Air Traffic Control IT industry in at least 15 different countries and specialise in Flight Data Processing (FDP). I have a company called Flight ATM Systems Ltd. (www.flightatm.com) that tried to sell FDP related software products through (although with very limited success). I often received requests for the software at basement bargain prices which was impossible to do given the quantity of sales we made through the company. As a result of numerous enquiries for 'cheaper' FDP products I have decided to re-write some of (or maybe all) of the FDP software I have written to date in Python and started this GitHub account in order to make this an open source project.
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering in general. I have a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics and almost completed an MBA in Technology Management (2.5 of 3 years completed). In my younger years I started off life as an electronics engineer; hence I have a very good understanding of both hardware and software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python by re-writing all my FDP software in Python, (currently its all in Java). This will take a while, but I'm starting with one of the more complicated parts, the ICAO Field 15 parser. Its not a wildy popular subject but it is a good way to learn Python!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects releated to FDP processing should anyone be mad enough to be working on this not so well understood topic. I'm new to GitHub and will no doubt make many mistakes in setting this up, hence constructive feedback welcome.
- 📫 I can be contacted at peter.venton@flightatm.com
